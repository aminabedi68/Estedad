**Estedad** (`/~este~dAd/`, meaning *“Talent”* in Persian) is an Arabic–Latin sans-serif typeface family available in 9 standard weights, along with a variable font (`wght` axis).

Estedad supports a wide range of Arabic and Latin codepoints, covering most use cases for both writing systems.  
The design is simple, smooth, and compact, with low contrast and a relatively small optical size (slightly increased in bold and heavier weights). The typeface is optimized for screen and web-oriented environments. 

_The variable font quality has been improved in accordance with **FontBakery** recommendations._

- **Weight (`wght`)**: 100–900

## Build (Variable Font)

### Recommended
Open the source file in **Glyphs**, then:  
**Export → Variable**

### Alternative (Not Recommended)
Using [fontmake](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontmake):

```bash
fontmake -o variable -g Estedad.glyphs
```

_(NOT RECOMMENDED: in this method fontmake couldn't handle the Axis Mapping and Decompose Components CP)_
